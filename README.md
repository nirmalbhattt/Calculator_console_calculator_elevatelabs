# Console Calculator (Java)

A simple **console-based calculator** made in Java.  
It lets you do **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** in a loop until you exit.  
The calculator also **remembers the last result**, so you can keep calculating with it.

---

## How It Works
1. First, choose an operation from the menu.  
2. Enter two numbers â†’ calculator shows the result.  
3. Next time, enter only **one new number** (it continues from the last result).  
4. Repeat until you choose **Exit**.

Do you want me to make this README even shorter (just installation + one example), or is this level of detail okay?
